Implementation of promo code feature

* Generate promo code in Rails Admin (amount or percent)
* Method for bulk cloning object in Rails Admin
* Promo code form that accepts promo code in specific format
* Apply promo code and updates price in checkout remotely (without page refresh)
* Promo code is still in cart after page reload or even when user navigates out from cart (to browse shop more, for example)

Most of CSS, JS, views are legacy code, where I followed the code structure.

JS file has comments above the feature related code I've written.
